PLEASE DO NOT purchase the items from this app. No items will be delivered. PC Planet is simply a project to display my understanding of ReactJS.


### Known Issues

- Notebook styling for all aspects of site must be addressed. Currently comfortable with destop and mobile styling. (Zooming out to roughly 75% on Chrome has helped tremendously in the meantime)
- Stlying and data handling after Paypal purchase

### Current Focus

- Overhaul of product page
- Notebook styling
- Filling a Paypal sandbox account with test/dummy funds to test post-purchase screen
